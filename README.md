Election Project for MATE 2800

Go to https://playcode.io to test code out.

I created this game for my election project for MATE 2800, play as one of the two candiates competing in election graded on condorcet criterion.

The Condorcet candidate is the person who would win a two-candidate election against each of the other candidates in a plurality vote.For a set of candidates, the Condorcet winner is always the same regardless of the voting system in question.

Play as one candidate in the winner takes all system represented by a circle that you are free to control. The opposing party is the enemy in this case. Your goal is to collect the most votes, represented by smaller circles, and eat your opponent before they eat you. If you win the plurality, in this case the most votes collected in comparision to your enenemy, then you win by consuming your enemy. 

I can't take full credit for this idea, the consept of this game and similar gameplay mechanics can be found at https://agar.io/ , in which I took inspiration from. My game is similar, but I have developed it to be indivual, a stand alone, and fit the subject matter of my MATE 2800 cource.
